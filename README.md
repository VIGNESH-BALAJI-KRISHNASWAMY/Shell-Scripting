# Shell-Scripting
Collection of Bash scripts for Linux automation, file handling, and system tools.
# Shell Scripting Lab

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts I wrote while practicing Linux shell scripting.
They are organized by topic into folders (patterns, math, text, files, directories, and system tools).

The goals of this lab are to:

- Got comfortable with Bash syntax, loops, conditionals, and arrays  
- Practiced input validation and error handling  
- Used common Linux command-line tools (`bc`, `sed`, `df`, `ps`, `uname`, `tr`, etc.)  
- Performed build on small but complete command-line utilities instead of one-line snippets
